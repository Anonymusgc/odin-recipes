          <p>
            Tofu can be a hard sell. There are many complaints about its bland
            texture and flavor, but when given a special treatment, a
            transformation takes place. This recipe calls for extra-firm tofu
            that has been frozen, a trick my mom taught me. Once defrosted,
            you’ll see that the tofu has become more porous, almost sponge-like:
            this new texture enables it to absorb flavors more readily. It works
            perfectly in a stir-fry and equally well in soups and stews. Another
            one of mom’s tricks? To simmer the tofu in salted water briefly
            before stir-frying. Apparently this makes the tofu hardier and less
            likely to crumble when jostled in the pan. I don’t question my
            mother’s wisdom, but this step is totally optional.
          </p>

            Stir-fries are like salads: you can put almost whatever in it and it
            will be a quick, healthy, delish meal. I’ve put in my favorite
            veggies into this recipe, but please feel free to substitute
            whatever hearty vegetables you have on hand. Growing up, my father
            even put iceberg lettuce in the mix, which I definitely do not
            recommend. Almost anything aside from salad greens will do:
            cauliflower, bok choy, onions, thin slices of potato, celery,
            corn...the possibilities are endless.

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a medium pot of salted boiling water, simmer tofu for 2
              minutes. If using frozen tofu, simmer until completely defrosted.
              Remove from heat and let drain in a colander lined with paper
              towels. When cool enough to handle, gently squeeze and pat dry. If
              using frozen tofu, use firmer pressure to squeeze out water.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut tofu into bite-sized pieces, then toss together with soy
              sauce, sesame oil, and black pepper in a medium bowl. Once liquids
              are absorbed, toss tofu with cornstarch.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil.
              Add tofu and let cook until golden on all sides, turning
              occasionally, 7 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and
              remove from skillet and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil and add in garlic and ginger and
              cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in string beans, carrots,
              broccoli, red pepper, and green onions. Cook until tender, about 8
              to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a small bowl, stir together soy sauce, sesame oil, water, brown
              sugar, and cornstarch. Return tofu to skillet and add sauce
              mixture to pan. Stir and cook until slightly thickened, 2 minutes.
