          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Proof the yeast:</b> Place the warm water in the large bowl of
              a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water
              and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved. After 5
              minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast
              should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still
              active and alive. (Note that if you are using "instant yeast"
              instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. Just add to
              the flour in the next step.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Make and knead the pizza dough:</b> Add the flour, salt, sugar,
              and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low
              speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough
              hook attachment. Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed
              using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes. If you don't have a
              mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by
              hand. The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch.
              If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Let the dough rise:</b> Spread a thin layer of olive oil over
              the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and
              turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil. At this point
              you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A
              slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more
              complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in
              a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work
              with. Cover the dough with plastic wrap. For a quick rise, place
              the dough in a warm place (75°F to 85°F) for 1 1/2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Divide the dough into 2 balls:</b> Remove the plastic cover
              from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down
              so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half. Form 2 round balls
              of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let
              sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Prep the toppings:</b> Prepare your desired toppings. Note that
              you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of
              toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way. About a
              third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient
              for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a
              pizza.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Flatten the dough ball</b>, and stretch out into a round:
              Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and
              flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface.
              Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips
              to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough
              until it will not stretch further. Let the dough relax 5 minutes
              and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired
              diameter—10 to 12 inches. Treat the dough gently! You can also
              hold up the edges of the dough with your fingers, letting the
              dough hang and stretch, while working around the edges of the
              dough.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings:</b> Spoon
              on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired
              toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with
              too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Slide pizza into the oven:</b> Sprinkle some cornmeal on the
              baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!).
              Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if
              not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more
              cornmeal. Slide the pizza off of the peel and onto the baking
              stone in the oven.
